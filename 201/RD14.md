## CSS Transforms

### 2D
- **Transform Property** comes in two dimentsional and three dimensional transforms
  - Two Dimensional transforms work the x and y axis
  - three dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axxes as well as the z axis
- **Translate** value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions with out interupting th enomal flow of the document
- **Scale** scale is a value to set both the x and y axis values at once
- **skew** is used to distor elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis or both
`transform-origin` property can accept one or two values and changes the default
- **None** The none value turns off any perspctive

### 3D

- we can rotate an element around any axes.
  - rotateX
  - rotateY
  - rotateZ
- Skew CANOT be transformed on the three dimensional scale
- **Transform Style** allows nested elements to transform in their own three dimensional plane 

## Transitions and Animations

- Transitions- elements change in state
  - :hover, :focus, :active, :target
- **Transition-property** determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties
- Not all properties my be transitioned
- **Transition Duration** duration in which a transition takes place
- **transition-timing-function** is used to set the speed in which a transition will move
- **Transition-delay** can also set delay
- `@keyframes` to set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition
- **animation-name** animationions behave similarly to transitions
- animation-fill mode- identifies hwo an elemetn should be styled either befor after or before and after an animation is run

## 8 Simple CSS Transitions

2. Change Color `.color:hover`
3. Grow & Shrink `.grow:hover`
4. Rotate Elements `.rotate:hover`
5. Square to circle `.circle:hover`
6. 3D shadow `threed:hover`
