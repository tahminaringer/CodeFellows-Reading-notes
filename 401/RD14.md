# Event Driven Architecture

- Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
  - FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and enactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unitentional duplications from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers

- How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
  - By sending a confimation message that client received message or storing in a queue.

- What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming? Not sure, could not find.

- How do you test an event driven system?

  - using event driven testing which functions within the application input data and output data via messages that are stored in a message queue.

- FIFO Queue - data structure that is first in first out or item that was inserted first will be removed first

- Pub/Sub - Publisher/Subscriber pattern is a pattern that allows us to create modules that can communicate with each other without depending directly on each other

- SNS - Publisher/Subscriber System
  - Publishing messages to a topic can deliver to many subscribers of different types
- SQS - Queueing service for message processing
  - a system must pull the queue to discover new events
  - Messages in the queue are typically proceesed by a single consumer
