    b. solve the problem with at least three different inputs
  3. Optimize the manual steps
    a. Figure out if there is another wat you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut out or simplify.
  4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
    a. capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.
  5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code
    a. if your struggle here you either didn't breakdown the problem into small enough steps or you do not know your programing language well enough to do the conversion.
  6. Optimize the real code

  a. You understand when you can explain it well
  b. write down your problem, draw diagram or talk it out
2. Plan - map out your solution before starting
  a. write out the steps- give your brain time to analyze the problem
3. Divide- Break the problem into sub-problems
  a. once sub problems are solved connect all the dots which will give you the solution to the big problem
4. Stuck - If you get stuck breath through it and take a break
  a. debug - go step by step through you solution trying to finde the error
  b. Reassess -  Take a step back and look at problem from another perspective
    Sometimes this means to delete everything and start fresh

## The 5 Whys - Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

1. Assemble a Team
- Gather people who are familiar with the specific problem
  - appoint someone to act as facilitator - who can keep the team focused

2. Define the Problem
  - Observe the problem in action and discuss with your team
  - write a concise, clear, brief problem statement
  - write question on whiteboard with room for brainstorming

3. Ask the First "Why?"
  - Ask team why the problem is occuring
  - Search for answers that are grounded in fact.
  - write answers as succinct phrases next to problem statement

4. Ask "Why?" Four more times
  - For each answer from step three ask four further "whys" in succession- frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded

5. Know when to stop

6. Address the Root Cause(s) - Discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring

7. Monitor your Measures - Pay attention to how counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem and reassess where needed.
