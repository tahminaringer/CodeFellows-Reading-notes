# Custom Hooks

## Terms

- state hook - lets you hook into React features
- effect hook - lets you perform side effects in function components
- reducer hook - accepts a reducer of type and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.

- What does a component’s lifecycle refer to? The 3 main phases Mounting, Updating and Unmounting
- Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect. If you are passing the function to a child component as props and the child component doesn't need rerendering
- Why are functional components preferred over class components? They are easier to read and test and simplify your code.
- What is wrong with the following code?

```js
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

//passing props but it is never used
function MyComponent(props) {

  //Don't believe you need to pass 0 in the useState
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

//should be in an useEffect()
  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

//don't think this for loop is necessary
  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);
// line below does not make any sense
    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

// <div> needs to be returned on own line
// <input> value and change should be strings not objects
  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```
