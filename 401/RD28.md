# Component Composition

- Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
  - Yes, most commonly by using a callback function triggered by the child component that tosses the values upward to the parent
- What can be passed along in a prop variable?
  - Read- only components and state passed to child components.
- How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
  - If it is a child component by passing props if it is a component that shares a common ancestor they can access the same state.

- **component props** Component properties and are used to pass data from one component to another
- **component state** Object where component property values are stored.
- **application state** Interface between data and backend and the representation of this data with UI elements in the frontend. State keeps the data of different components in sync by rendering all relevent components when a state is updated.
