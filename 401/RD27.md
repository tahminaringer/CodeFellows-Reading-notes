# Props and State

- Does a deployed React application require a server?
  - Node is not required inorder to use React npx is its own Node tool which allows you to run a package.
Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
  - We can test components that are not purely functional but also responsible for behavior. Helps build better apps and test functionality works how you expect it to.
- What does npm run build do?
  - Allows you to do the necessary building tasks for your app. It is an internal command that is called by link and install commands.
- Describe the actual composition / architecture of a - React application
  - React does not enforce an architecture pattern. It is a view that caters to the user interface and just beneath the UI is a tree of many React components

- **BDD** Behavior Driven Development- testing your product and not just your code and makes sure the app works as expected.
- **Acceptance Tests** help test user senarios with UI and determine the app/software needs. Decides if the client approves the app/software
- **mounting** is the phase that React mounts on the DOM
- **build** directory with a production build of the app which includes js and CSS files.
