# Routing

- Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?
  - No parent passes a function to the child through props, child calls the function and then passes it a value that the parent can then react to.
- When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
  - By calling setState and giving the new props you want to propagate down or if needed by calling `forceUpdate()`
- Can a component, such as `<Content />`, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
  - Yes... Need to look into this more not sure
- What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children.
  - By passing the entire props object or listing them out singly.

- **props.children** Can be used on components that represent generic boxes and don't know their children ahead of time
- **composition** Natural pattern of the component model. It is how we build components from other components, of varying complexity and specialization through props.
