# Authentication

### Singleton

- An object that can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to it's constructor return the same instance which can guarentee that two users are not created in a single applicant.

### Singleton Patern used with Node Modules/Classes

- Check within the constructor to see if an instance has previously been created
- If there is not a singleton instance then we want to create one.
- If we do not have one then the singleton  instance will equal new logger
- It will only allow one instance created whenever we instantiate this singleton class

### Building a Middleware System

- install Node.js and Express
- require express
- have a HTTP method for that applies to the middleware function
- add a path or route
- write my middleware functions to take 3 parameters `(req, res, next)`
- send a request, response or call next
- connect to a PORT

### TERMS

- **Router Middleware** middle layer of software that is an server framwork allowing you to create your app routes to your database
- **Dynamic Module Loading** provides the backbone for the code structure. Modularizes code base
- **Singleton Pattern** design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object
- **CRUD -> REST Method Matches**
  - Create = PUT with new URI, Post to a base URI returning newly created URI
  - Read = GET
  - Update = PUT with existing URI
  - Delete = DELETE
- **Mock Testing**
- Allows testing of the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function/parameters, capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values
- **Authentication** = you are who you say you are
- **Authorization** = you are allowed access based on who you are
  - client enters credentials and they get sent to server who then requests from the data base to check for credetials.
  - Database responds to server
  - server responds to client if authorized or not
