# Hooks API

- Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
  - The views are coded in JSX format as components
- If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
  - Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />` BrowserRouter renders anything inside and the Route tages represent links between the components

- What does props.children contain?
  -It contains whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking the component.

- **Composition** a natural patern of the component model and how we build components from other components
- **Children / Child Components** allow you to pass components as data to other components.
- **Hash Routing** uses the hash in the URL to render the component.
- **Link Routing** provides the link components which allow you to navigate to different routes defined in the app.
