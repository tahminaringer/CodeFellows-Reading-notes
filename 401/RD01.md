## `Array.map()`

- This method can take in two arguments(first required, second optional), creates a new array without altering the original array and calls the callback function for each element in the array in order, returning a new array of the results. It does not exicute the function for array elements without a value.

## `Array.reduce()`

- reduces the array to a single value, calls a function for each value of the array(from L - R) and the return value of the fucntion is stored in an accumulator. Reduce does not execute the fuction for array elements without values and does not change the original array.

## `superagent()`

```JS
let URL = 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/'

superagent.get(url)
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data.body);
  })
```

```JS
async function getCity(city) {
  let results = await superagent.get(`https://geocode.xyz/${city}?json=1`);
  console.log(results.body.latt, results.body.longt);
}
getCity('Missoula');
```

## Promises

- Promise is an object that represents that will eventually complete based on an asynchronous operation and it's single result value. It is single threaded meaning only one part of script can run at the same time. A promise coan be in three states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.


## Are all callbacks Asynchronous?

- No not all callbacks are asynchronous and matters how the argument is used inside the function. Asynchronous functions need to prerform and asynchronous operation. It needs to incorperate the argument callback in handling the results of this asynchronous operation.
