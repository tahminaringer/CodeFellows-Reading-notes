# Combined Reducers

1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
  - if you need to change your apps state or component structure at some point it can lead to significant refactoring. Redux helps with routing where we might not be using our components via JSX

2. What is the purpose of a reducer?
  - it determines changes to an applications state by using the action it receives.

3. What does an action contain?
  - It carries a payload of information from your application to store
4. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
  - If the new state is different, the reducer must create new object, and making a copy of the state is a way to describe the unchanged part

## Terms
- **immutable state** state that cannot be changed
- **time travel in redux** Redux DevTools records dispached actions and the state of the store at every poitn in time. This makes it possible to inspect the state at any point in time or "travel back in time"
- **action creator** a fuction that returns an action object
- **reducer** function that determines changes to an applications state by using an action it recieves to determine the change.
- **dispatch** helps you call store, dispatch to dispatch action and is the only way to trigger a state change.
