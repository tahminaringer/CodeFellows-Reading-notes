# Context API

- Describe use cases for `useMemo()` and `useReducer()`
  - `useReducer()` - Use when you are dealing with a complex object where individual properties need to be operated on
  - `useMemo()` memorizes a value to the cache, and does not run again during re-renders unless the value of the data is changed
- Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
  - it is a convention to identify hook functions which will generally call at the very top of a component render method
- What do custom hooks usually do?
  - let you use state and other React features without writing a class. it lets you extract component logic into reusable functions
- Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
  - use-redux hook - returns the store and dispatch properties and I am pretty sure we will be learning about it next week.
- Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
  - The effect hook or `useEffect` fetches data by using axios from the API and sets the data in the local state of the component with the state hooks update function

- **reducer** a react function that determines changes to an applications state
