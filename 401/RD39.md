# Redux - Additional Topics

- What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application? 
  - fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method of a higher order component that wraps your App.
- When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
  - you default export the whole function

## Term
- **middleware** Provides a way to interact with actions that have been dispatched to the store before they reach the store's reducer
- **thunk** Middle ware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object.
- **Redux Toolkit** standard way to write Redux logic
  - configuring a complex store
  - have to add a lot of packages for get redux to work with app
  - requires a lot of boiler plate code

- `configureStore()`: wraps createStore to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults.
- `createReducer()`: that lets you supply a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions, rather than writing switch statements
- `createAction()`: generates an action creator function for the given action type string
- `createSlice()`: accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types.
- `createAsyncThunk`: accepts an action type string and a function that returns a promise, and generates a thunk that dispatches pending/fulfilled/rejected action types based on that promise
- `createEntityAdapter`: generates a set of reusable reducers and selectors to manage normalized data in the store
- `The createSelector utility` from the Reselect library, re-exported for ease of use.
