# THE CALL STACK

## Call Stack

- **Call Stack** Is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple fuctions
  - When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
  - any fuctions that are called by that function are added to the call stack futher up, and run where their calls are reached.
  - When the current function is finished the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing
  - if the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error

## The JS Call Stack

- JS Engine- Is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack
- Call stack is a single function execution is done one at a time from top to bottom.
  - call stack is synchronous
- **LIFO** last in first out= last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be popped out when the function returns.
- **Stack overflow** occurs when there is a recursive function (function that calls itself) without an exit point

## JavaScript error messages && debugging

- **reference errors** ex: when you use a variable that is not yet declared
  - `const & let` Temparal Dead Zone TDZ
- **Syntax errors** cannot be parsed in tearms of syntax, like parsing an invalid object using JSON parse
- **Range Errors** happens when manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length. EX: an array can not have a negative length
- **Type Errors** the types (number,sting etc) you are using are incompatible. Ex: accessing a property in an undefined type of variable
- **Tools to avoid runtime errors**
  - quokka- to evaluate your code as you type
  - eslint- to make sure your style guid is consistency and it will grab you an error or two along the way
  - TypScript
