- then use `heroku login` command to login
- Sample application to be diployed
`git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git
cd node-js-getting-started`
  - This creates a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as package.json file.

### Deploy

- **Create an app on Heroku**
`heroku create
Creating sharp-rain-871... done, stack is heroku-18
http://sharp-rain-871.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/sharp-rain-871.git
Git remote heroku added`

  - Heroku generates a random name for your app or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name
  `git push heroku main`
  - verify one instance of the app is running
  `heroku ps:scale web=1`
  - Short cut command to open depoyed site `heroku open`

### view Logs

`heroku logs --tai`

- is a text file in the root dirrectory of your application, to explicitly declare what command should be executed to start your app.

### Scale the app

- check how many dynos running using `heroku ps`

### Declare app dependencies

- Heroku recognizes an app as Node.js by the ecistence of `package.json` file in the root dirrectory. You can create your own by running `npm init--yes`

### Run app locally
