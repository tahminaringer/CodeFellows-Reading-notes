# What is Node and When Should I Use it?

- Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library
  - V8 Engin is the open-source JS engin that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers.
  - Designed with perfomance in mind and is responsible for compiling JS directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

## What is Node.js used for?

- build tools designed to automate the process of developing a modern JS application

- **Benefits**
  - single-threaded
  - **event driven** everthing that happens in Node is in reaction to an event
  - Execution model causes the server little overhead and is capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.
    1. node apps pass async tasks to the event loop, along with a call back
    2. the event loop efficiently manages a thread pool and executes tasks efficiently
    3. and excecutes callback as tasks complete
  - can easily share code between server and client
  - speaks JSON

## React Hooks

- React hooks are special function that allow you to hook into react features in function components
  - Means you no longer need to define a class when construction a React component. 
  - simplifies code and makes it easier to read
- Create React app - `npx create-react-app myapp`
  - creates `myapp` folder
- Change into folder and start the developemtn server as follows 
  - `cd myapp`
  - `npm start`
- **Side Effects** Operations to perform a specific operation such as fetching data, subscribing to a data stream, or manually changing the DOM
- **Official React Hooks**
  - `useState` for managing local state
  - `useEffect` replaces lifecycle functions
  - `useContext` allows you to easily work with the React Context API(solving the prop drilling issue)
  - `useReducer` for managing complex state logic
  - `useCallback` returns a function that returns a cacheable value. Useful for performance optimization if you want to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the input hasn't changed.
  - `useMemo` returns a value from a memorized fuction
  - `useRef` returns a mutable ref object that persists for the lifetime of the component
  - `useImperativeHandle` customizes the instance value that's exposed to parent components when using `ref`
  - `useLayoutEffect` similar to `useEffect` but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations
  - `useDebugValue` displays a label for custom Hooks in React Developer Tools.

## Getting Started with React: A Beginner's Guide

- React is a remarkable JS library that's taken the development community by storm
  - makes it easier to build interactive user interfaces for web, mobile and desktop platforms
- React applications are built using reusable UI components that can interact with each other
  - can be class based component or function component
    - Class based components are defined using ES6 classses 
    - function components are basic JS functions
- Create new app `create-react-app message-app`
- `npx i -g create-react-app` allows you to download and run a package without installing it
  - `yarn start` starts the development server
  - `yarn build` bundles the app into static files for production
  - `yarn test` starts the test runner
  - `yarn eject` removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directiory. I you do this you can not go back!
- **Stateless Component** or dumb component- is simply a component that displays information
- **Hooks** Make it possible to take a React function component and add state to it
