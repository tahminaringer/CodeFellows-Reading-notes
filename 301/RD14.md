# Database Normalization

- Database normalization is a precess used to organize a database into table and columns
  - table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics inculuded.
  - by limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database
  - 3 reasons for database normalization
    1. minimize duplicate data
    2. minimize or avoid data modification issues
    3. simplify queries

## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies

- data duplication presents 2 problems
  - increases storage and decrease performance
  - it becomes mor difficult to maintain data changes
- 3 modification anomalies 
  1. insert anomaly - there are facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row
  2. update anomaly - same information in several rows
  3. Deletion anomaly - deletion of a row causes removal of more than one set of facts.

## Search and Sort Issues

- makes it easier to search and sort your data.
- **First Normal Form** the information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no groups of columns
- **Second Normal Form** The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table's primary key.
- **Third Normal Form** The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
