# READ 02- Chapter 7 jQuery/Pair Programing

- offers simple quick way to achieve common JS tasks
  - Easier to access elements and elements are more flexible and powerful
  - allows you to update the dom tree
  - allows you to attach events without any fall back code.
- JS file that you include in your web pages and allows you to find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do somethng with the elements
- **Similarities to DOM**
  - perform similar tasks/much simpler syntax
  - can store the jQuery object in a variable
  - you can use methods and properties to manipulate the DOM nades that you select.
- **Differences from DOM**
  - It's cross-browser, and no need to write fallback code
  - Selecting elements is simpler
  - event handling is simpler uses method that works in all major browsers
  - Methods affect all the selected elements without the need to loop through each one
  - additional methods are provided for popular required tasks such as animation
  - Once you have made a selection you can applay multiple methods to it
- to use jQuery you need to include the jQuery script in your page. place before closing body tag
- **Why JQuery**
  1. Simple Selectors
  2. Common tasks in less code
  3. cross-browser compatability
- when you select one or more elements a jQuery object is returned. Also known as a *matched set or jquery selector*
- **Single Element**if selector returns one element- jQuery object contains a referece to just one element node
- **Multiple Elements** If a selector returns several elements, the jQuery object contains references to each element. 
- Some jQuery methods both retieve information from and update the contents of elements. but don't apply to all elements
- **Get Information** if jQuery selection holds more than one element and a method is user to get information It will retieve info from only the first element
- **Set Information** If a jQuery selection holds more than one element and a method is used to update information on the page, it will update all of the elements in the matched set not just the first one.
- When you create a selection with jquery it stores a reference to the corresponding nodes in the DOM tree.
- Caching a jQuery object stores a reference to it in a variable
- **Looping** when selector returns multiple elements you can update all of them using the one method
- **implicit iteration** the ability to update all of the elements in the jQuery selection
- Use `each()` when you want to get info from a series of elements
- **Chaining** to use more than one jQuery method on the same selection of elements you can list several methods at a time using dot notation to separate each one
- `ready()` checks that the page is ready for your code to work with
- **Getting Element Content** 
  - `.html() and .text()` both retrieve and update the content of elements
    - html- When this method is used to retrieve info it retrieves only the html inside the first element in the matched set along with any of its decendants.
    - text- used to retieve the text, returns the content from every element in the jQuery selection along with the text from any descendants.
  - `.replaceWith()` relaces every elementin a matched set with new content. returns the replaced elements
  - `remove()` removes all of the elements in the matched set.
- **Inserting elements**
  1. create the new elements in a jQuery object
  2. Use a method to insert the content into the page.
  - `.before()` this method inserts conten before the selected element
    - `.after()` Inserts content after the selected elements
    - `.prepend()` inserts content inside the selected element after the opening tag
    - `.append()` inserts content inside the selected elements before the closing tag
    - `.attr()` sets specific attribute and its value
    - `.removeAttr()` removes specified attribute
    - `.addClass()`
    - `.removeClass`
    - `.css()` lets you retrieve and set the values of CSS properties
    - `.each()` allows tou to perform one or more statements on each of the items in the selection of elements that is returned by a selector/similar to loop in JS
    - `this` as the .each() method goes through the elemetns in a selection, you can access the current elementusing the this keyword. 
    - `$(this)` uses the this keyword to create a new jQuery selection containing the current element and us jQuery methods on the current element
    - `.on()`haddles all events
  - every event handling function receives an event object
    - `.show()` Displays selected elements
    - `.hide()` Hides selected elements
    - `.toggle()` Toggles between shoing and hiding selected elements
    - `.fadeIn()` Fades in selected elements making them opaque
    - `.fadeOut()` Fades out selected elements making them transparent
    - `. fadeTo()` Changes opacity of slected elements
    - `.fadeToggle()` Hides or shows selected elements by changing their opacity
    - `.slideUp()`Hides selected elements with a sliding motion
    - `.slideDown()` Shows selected elements with a sliding motion
    - `.slideToggle()` Hides or shows selected elements with a sliding motion
    - `.delay()` Delays execution of subsequent items in queue
    - `.stop()` Stops an animation if it is currently running
    - `.animate()` Creates custom animations
