# SQL

## Introduction to SQL

- **SQL** Structured Query Language- a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, ,manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. 
  - provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications
- **Relational Database** represents a collection of related, two dimmensional, tables
  - similar to excell with fixed number of named columns and number of rows of data

### Select queries

- `.SELECT` retrieves data from a SQL database
- Query - statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.
- If selecting more than one element separate by using a comma
- To select all items `*`
- `=,!=, < <=, >, >=` Standard numerical operators
- `BETWEEN ...AND` Number is within range of two values(inclusive)
- `NOT BETWEEN ... AND` Number is not within range of two values (inclusive)
- `IN (...)` number exists in a list
- `NOT IN (...)` Number does not exist in a list
- `WHERE` Used to filter a certain result from being returned
  `SELECT id, title FROM movies`
  `WHERE id = 6;`

### Queries with constraints

- `=` Case sensitive exact string comparison(notice single equals)
- `!=or<>` Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison
- `LIKE` Case insensitive exact string comparison
- `NOT LIKE` Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison
- `%` Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)
- `-` Used anywhere in a string to match a single character(only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)
- `IN(...)` String exists in a list
- `NOT IN (...)` String does not exist in a list

### Filtering and sorting Query results

- `DISTINCT` convienient way to sidcard rows that have a duplicate column value
  - can remove duplicate rows,
- **schema** what descrives the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain.
- `INSTERT INTO` declares which table to write into, the columns of data that we are filling and one or more rows of dta to insert
- `UPDATE` `SET` Updates existing data
- `DELETE FROM` `WHERE` delete data from a table in a data base
- `CREATE TABLE` creates new data table
- `ALTER TABLE` add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints
- `DROP TABLE` removes an entire table including all of its data and metadata. Also removes the table schema from the data base entirely
