# Responsive Web Design & Floats

## Shay Howe's Intro to RWD

- is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, small, large, mobile or desktop
- provides gratifying and intuitive experience for all
- Ethan Marcotte- developed RWD
### Responsive Websites 
- to react quickly and positively to any change
- continually and fluidly change based on different factors like viewport width
- 3 main components
  1. **flexible layouts**- building with a flexible grid- capable of resizing to any width
    - Do not use px or in
    - **Flexible Grid** build using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. 
      - used to declare common grid property values such as widthm margin, or padding
      - Relative Viewport Lengths
        - `vw` Viewports width
        - `vmin` Minimum of the viewport's height & width
        - `vh` Viewports height
        - `vmax` Maximum of the viewport's height and width
      - **Flexible Grid Layout Formula**
        - `target/context=result` or the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of it's parent element resulting in the relative width of the target element
  2. media queries
    - ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances suchas width of the viewport or device orientation.
    - **3 ways to use**
      - `@media` rule inside of existing style sheet
      - `@import` rule imports a new style sheet
      - `@media` rule links to a separate style sheet from within the HTML. Best to use inside of an existing style sheet to avoid extra HTTP requests
    - Logical Operators- help build powerful expressions
      - **3 logical Operators**
        - and
        - not
        - only
    - Whem building a site it should adjust to an array of different view port sizes regardless of the device
    - **Mobile First** uses styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then uses media queries to add styles as the viewport grows    
  3. flexible media-
    - as viewports begin to change size media also needs to be sizeable
    - `max-width: 100%` to ensure that the viewport gets smaller and any media will follow suit within its container unit
      - This does not work well when using youtube or iframes
        - work around- The embedded element needs to be absoluetely positionded within a parent elelment. the parent element needs to have a width of 100% and a height of 0- triggers `hasLayout` mechanism


- **Adaptive Websites** to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change.
  - built to a group of preset factors.
- Using a combination of adaptive and responsive builds the best website.
- **Mobile** to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for the mobile users. 
  - not the best solution and many obstacles

## All About Floats

- Float is a CSS positioning property
- Absolute positioning are removed from the flow of the wepage.
- Absolute positioned elements will not affect the position of other elements and other elements will not affect them, whether they touch each other or not.
- float can be used to create entire web layouts and wrap text around images
- when images are resized the text in the box will reflow to accomodate.
- **Clearing the Float** an element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires but will move itself down past the float
- **Clear Values**
  - Both- is most commonly used and clears floats coming from either dirrection
  - Left/Right- clears the float from on direction.
- **Collapsed Parent Element** Solution clear the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container

### Problems with Floats

- **Pushdown** element inside a floated item being wider than the float itself
  - fix - use `overflow: hidden` to cut off excess
- **Double Margin Bug** If you apply a margin in the same direction as the float, it will double the margin
  - fix- set `display:inline` on the float, and dont worry it will remain a block-level element
- **3px Jog**when text that is up next to a floated element is mysteriously kicked away by 3px
  - fix- set a width or height on the affected text
- **Bottom Margin Bug** floated parent has floated children inside it, bottom margin on the children is ignored by the parent
  - fix - using bottom padding on the parent instead

## Don't Overthink it Grids

- **Columns**- to make them next to each other we need to float them and apply widths
  - Clear the parent element to keep from collapsing
- **Gutters** 
  - `box-sizing: border-box;` 
  - apply fixed padding
- **Outside Gutters** 
  - add left padding to the grid parent
  - restore right padding to the last column
