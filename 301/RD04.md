  - `\.\*\\` escaped special characters
  - `\t\n\r` tab, linefeed, carriage return

  - `(abc)` capture group
  - `\1` backreference to group #1
  - `(?:abc)` non-capturing group
  - `(?=abc)` positive lookahead
  - `(?!abc)` negative lookahead

- **Quntifiers & Alternation**
  - `a* a+ a?` 0 or more, 1 or mor 0 or 1
  - `a{5} a{2,}` exactly five, two or more
  - `a{1,3}` between one & three
  - ` a+? a{2,}?` match as few as possible
  - `ab|cd` match ab or cd

  ## Regex Tutorial

  - useful for extracting information from any text.
  - parsing/replacing strings/ passing through translating data to other formats/ web scraping
  - used in most languages

### Anchors - `^and$`

- `^The` matches any string that starts with The -> Try it!
- `end$` matches a string that ends with end
- `^The end$`exact string match (starts and ends with The end)
- `roar` matches any string that has the text roar in it

### Quantifiers - `*+?and{}`

- `abc*`matches a string that has ab followed by zero or more c
- `abc+` matches a string that has ab followed by one or more c
- `abc?`matches a string that has ab followed by zero or one c
- `abc{2}`matches a string that has ab followed by 2 c
- `abc{2,}`matches a string that has ab followed by 2 or more c
- `abc{2,5}`matches a string that has ab followed by 2 up to 5 c
- `a(bc)*`matches a string that has a followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc
- `a(bc){2,5}`matches a string that has a followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence bc

### OR Operator `-|or[]`

- `a(b|c)`matches a string that has a followed by b or c (and captures b or c) 
- `a[bc]`same as previous, but without capturing b or c

### Character classes - `\d\w\s and .`

- ``\d `matches a single character that is a digit 
- ``\w `matches a word character (alphanumeric character plus underscore)
- ``\s `matches a whitespace character (includes tabs and line breaks)
- `.`matches any character
- `\D` matches a single non-digit character
- `\$\d` matches a string that has a $ before one digit

### Grouping and Capturing - `()`

- `a(bc)`parentheses create a capturing group with value bc 
- `a(?:bc)*`using ?: we disable the capturing group 
- `a(?<foo>bc)`using ?<foo> we put a name to the group

### Bracket Expressions `[]`

- `[abc]`matches a string that has either an a or a b or a c -> is the same as a|b|c 
- `[a-c]`same as previous
- `[a-fA-F0-9]` a string that represents a single hexadecimal digit, case insensitively 
- `[0-9]%`a string that has a character from 0 to 9 before a % sign
- `[^a-zA-Z]`a string that has not a letter from a to z or from A to Z. In this case the ^ is used as negation of the expression
