# RD03 Flexbox and Templating

## Templating with Mustache
- Templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with JS by using a JSON data source.
  - html markup with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic
  - Template engine replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with values at runtime and convert the tmeplate in to an html file sent to the client
  - 
- **Mustache** is a logic-less template syntax used with html config files, source code, etc. 
  - Does not use if statements, else clauses or for loops.
  - Instead it uses only tags
  - mustache syntax uses  `{{double curly braces}}`
  - mustache is not a templating engine it is a specification for a templating language.

## Guide to Flexbox

- **display** This defines a fex container; inline or block depending on the given value.
  - enables a flex contenxt for all its direct children
- **Flex-direction** establishes the main axis, thuse defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.
  - *row* default: left to right in `ltr`; right to left in `rtl`;
  - *row-reverse* right to left in `ltr`; left to right in `rtl`;
  - *column* same as `row` but top to bottom
  - *column-reverse* same as row-reverse but bottom to top
**Flex-wrap** helps fix items from trying to fit on one line and allows items to wrap as needed
  - **nowrap*:default- all flex items will be on one line
  - **wrap*: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom
  - *wrap-reverse* flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top
- **flex-flow** this is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-warp properties, which together define the flex containers main and cross axes. 
  - `row nowrap` is default
- **Justify-content** defines alignment along the main axis
  - *flex-start* items are packed toward the start of the flex-dirrection/default
  - *flex-end* Items are packed toward the end of the flex-dirrection
  - *start* items are packed toward the start of the `writing-mode` dirrection
  - *end* items are packed toward the end of the `writing-mode` dirrection
  - *left* items are packed toward left edge of the container unless that doesnt make sense with the `flex-dirrection` the it behaves like `start`
  - *right* items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn't make sense with the `flex-dirrection` the it behaves like `start`
  - *center* items are centered along the line
  - *space between* items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the line start last item on the end line
  - *space around* items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them
  - *space-evenly* items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items is equal.
- **align-items** defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line
  - `stretch` stretch to fill the container
  - `flex-start/start/self-start` Items are placed at the start of the cross axis
  - `fex-end/end/self-end` items are placed at the end of the cross axis
  - `center` items are centered in the cross-axis
  - `baseline` items are algned such as their baselines align
- **align-content** aligns a flex containers lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axzxis
  - `normal` items are packed in their default position as if no value was set
  - `flex-start/start` items packed to the start of the container
  - `flex-end/end` items packed to the end of the container
  - `center` items centered in the container
  - `space-between` items evenly distributed
  - `space-around` items evenly distributed with equal space around each line
  - `space-evenly` items are evenly distributed with equal space around them
  - `stretch` lines stretch to take up the remaining space
**Properties for the Children**
- `order` controls the order in which items appear in the container
- `flex-grow` creates ability for a flex item to grow if necessary
- `flex-shrink` give the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary
- `flex-basis` defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed
- `flex` short hand for `flex-grow/shrink/basis`
- `align-self` allows the default alignment to be overridden for individual flex items
