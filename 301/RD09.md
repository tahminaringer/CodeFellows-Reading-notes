# Functional Programming

- **Functional Programming** programming paradigm- a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs- that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
- **pure fuctions or deterministic** returns the same result if given the same arguments and it does not cause any observable side effects
- if our function reads external files it is not a pure functio because the contents can change
- fuctions with random num generators can not be pure
- **Pure function Benefits**
  - code is easier to test
- **Immutability** Unchanging over time or unable to be changed
- `toLowerCase` converts the string to all lower case
- `trim` removes whitespace from both ends of a string
- `split & join` replaces all instances of match with replacement in a given string
- `slugify` combining the above for functions
`pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`
- **Fuctions as first class entities**
  - refer to it from constants and variables
  - pass it as a parameter to other functions
  - return it as result from other functions
- **Higher-order functions**
  - takes one or more functions as arguments
  - returns a fuction as its result
- `filter` given a collection we want to filter by attribute. function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection
- `map` transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values
- `reduce` receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items
