As Mahatma Gandhi Said:
>Be the change that you wish to see in the world.

## **Growth Mindset**

What growth mindset means to me is: Keeping an open mind and looking at my challenges as a way to learn and grow. Allowing my road blocks to become tools to improve my abilities and learn something new. It means changing adversity into away of self improvement and learning about myself and being willing to push my comfort. Growth mindset is being willing to make mistakes in order to learn and improve and lovingly challenging yourself to do better. It means that although you may not be an expert at something if you try and work at it you will learn.
