# Opporators & Loops

## Comparison Operators

- `==`-equal to - compares two values
- `!=` - is not equal to-compares two values(numbers, strings, booleans) to see if they are **NOT** the same
- `===` -strict equal- compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same
- `!==`-Strict not equal- compares two values to check that both the data type and value are **not** the same.
- `>` - greater than
- `<` - less than
- `>=`- greather than or = to
- `<=`- less than or = to

## Logical Operators

- comparison operators generally return values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
- logical opperator checks to see if both expressions are true
- `**&&**` This oporator tests more than one condition. `((2<5) && (3>=2))`
- `**||**` test at least one condition. if either expression returns true then expression returns true `((2<5) || (2<1))`.
- `**!**` This operator takes a single boolean value and inverts it.`!(2<1)`

## Loops

- Check a condition, if true, a code block will run. repeats
- **For** if need to run for specific amount of times use **for** loop
- ex: password- after entering wrong x amount times get blocked
- **While** if amount of times unknown. loops as long as condition is true
- continue to loop when user answers false, until user enter an answer that is true, runs until user answer is once again false. true and false interchangable- Password senario.
- **Do While** similar to *while* loop but will always run the statements inside the curly brac es atleast 1 even if statement is false
-**Initializeation** *i* Create a variable and set it to 0
- **Condition** will run until reaches a specific number
- **Update** Everytime loop runs it add one to the counter
