# How Computers Work

- input-Storage-Processing-Output-
- single wire = bit, more bits = more complex abilities
- wire- on or off electrical signal
- binary 1s and 0s

1. **Circuts and Logic**

  1a. process information- modifys information through curcits
  1b. ADDER- takes in two bits to find sum

2. **Memory/Imput**
  
  2a. **input**- converts physical input to bianary information/keybord/phone/car, etc
  2b. **Memory**- Stores Information
  2c. **CPU**- Central Processing Unit Calculates Information
  2d. **Output** Converts Information to Physical output /music out of speakers/ car drives, etc

3. Hardware and Software

  3a. **CPU**- master chip controls computer
  3b. knows which and when to use circuts
  3c. Opporating system helps control rest of computer. Switches between progarms
