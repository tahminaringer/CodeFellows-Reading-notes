### Paths- absolute and relative

- Absolute paths specify a location in relation to the root directory. Always begin with (/)
- Relative paths specify a location in relation to where we currently are in the system.

## Files

- obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is
- everything is a file (dirrectory, keybord, monitor, etc)
- File extension 2-4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file
  - denotes type of file
- path is a means to get to a paticular location in the system, location is a file
- **Case sensitivity matters**
- careful of spacing
- anything inside quotes is considered a single item
- Escape Character (\) Nullifies spcial meaning of the next character
- .(fullstop) = hidden file
-ls -a  - list the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
