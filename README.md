I am a floral designer turned software developer. I spent the past 20 years perfecting my floristry skills, the last five of which I owned and opporated my own designgit studio. I am excited to combine my past expertise with growing in a new career in tech. I have 5 year old twin boys, who challenge and inspire me to learn and grow as much as possible. This page consists of  of the notes I have taken of all the material we covered over the coarse of my studies at Code Fellows.
